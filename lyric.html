                Don’t even know how far I could’ve fallen, if it wasn’t for You
                Even when I wanted to give up, I could never resist Your love
                
                You are here when I feel like there’s no one
                You draw near to the ones with broken hearts
                
                You allow things to break in my life
                To make sure that I see with my eyes
                You are making a place for the blessings that You’ve prepared
                
                And Your grace is sufficient for me
                You know everything that I need
                So I lay all the troubles and burden down at Your feet
                
                What if the pain from letting it go
                Is stopping me to grow
                What if I had to release more
                So You could give me more
                
                You are here when I feel like there’s no one
                You draw near to the ones with broken hearts
                
                You allow things to break in my life
                To make sure that I see with my eyes
                You are making a place for the blessings that You’ve prepared
